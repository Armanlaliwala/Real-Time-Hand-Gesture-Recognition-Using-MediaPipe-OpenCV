# Real-Time-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Using-MediaPipe-OpenCV
I just built a real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe and OpenCV, capable of detecting gestures like: 👍 Thumbs Up 👎 Thumbs Down ✊ Fist 🎥 The system processes live video feed, detects hands, classifies the gesture, and saves the output as a video file with H.264 encoding for better compatibility.
